    <h2>My full name:<br>Roberto Vergilio Soares Junior    </h2>
    <h2>my nickname: <br>Roberto or Juninho</h2>
    <p> I'm Roberto, I'm married, I have two children, I have a degree in engineering and I'm studying web programming at BYUI.</p>

    <p>I'm from Brazil, I live in the interior of the state of SÃ£o Paulo, I really enjoy practicing sports, even though I don't have much time for it.</p>

    <p> I work at SENAI - SP here in my city. SENAI is a technical school that aims to train people for the industrial job market</p>

    <p> My favorite scripture is 1 Nephi 3:7 <br>
        7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father:<br>
         I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men,<br> 
         save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
    </p>
    <p> I especially like the part where you say that you're going to pave the way, that's very encouraging. </p>
