      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        •	Why will people come to your site?
        The aim of my website is to promote my work. On the site you'll find the activities I carry out, the tasks I can be contracted to do or even follow up, on the site we'll have future projects I've worked on so that my clients can have greater credibility and confidence in the quality of the service.
        •	What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
        I believe that the number one question that my website should answer is what is the quality of my service, this will be done through the images of the projects that will be on the site
              
        •	What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
        I think that the activity that will be carried out on my site will be publicity and relationships with clients and potential clients, all my data to be hired and my work will be there
        •	What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
        I'd like people to enter the home page and feel like they're in a place with lots of technology and security, as these are the services I'd like to offer.
        In addition to the images, an explanation of web development and what solutions we have and how this could be a differentiator for the client.
        •	Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
        I think that as I publicize my work and complete other projects, more and more potential clients will come to my site to see the projects I've done and how I can solve their problem, they'll come to be able to communicate with me and to get the quote for the project they have in mind

      <h3>Website Projects</h3>
      <p>
        What is a website?
      I can tell you one thing: if you have a company and you don't yet have a website, you're way behind the competition!
      In this article you'll learn about this topical subject that will bring more visibility to your business.
      Website is a combination of the words web (network) and site (site), meaning that a website is a place on the web. It is the word used to define the place where one or more pages are available to be accessed via the Internet. There are some basic elements that a website usually has. We'll explain them from the point of view of a business, but they are fully applicable to other causes, such as:
      Personal blog
      Non-profit organizations
      News portals
      Official pages
      Event pages
      To give you an example, imagine a physical store as a website, or just a website for short. The entrance to the store is the main page of the site, also called the Home page. The counter can be seen as a contact page, where the customer can talk to the store. The shelves are a page for displaying products, with sub-pages for each category of object.
      Can you understand a bit more?
      This was a very basic example to help you, but a website can go much further than that. Pages are customizable and adjustable according to the needs of each person or company. 
      Now visualize your business like this, and imagine how many people can visit your company online.
      According to data from Globo's G1 news portal, the 2018 ICT Households survey shows that 126.9 million Brazilians use the internet. Imagine today? That number is only growing. This proves the importance of companies having an online presence, regardless of their size or area of activity. If you're not seen by these people as being able to help them, then it's time to change that. 
      Wow, that's a lot.
      Now that you're more familiar with the world of websites, how about having your own?

      <h3>Python Projects</h3>
      <p>
        The origin of Python
        Launched in 1991, Python was created by Dutch mathematician and programmer Guido van Rossum, who at the time was working at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam.
        Interestingly, Python was named after the British comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus. According to van Rossum, he was looking for a short and mysterious name, and "Python" fit the bill.
        What is Python?
        Python is a programming language. In general, programming languages are responsible for communication between computers and human beings. They allow programs to be created to physically and logically control a machine, based on a series of instructions, symbols, keywords, etc.
