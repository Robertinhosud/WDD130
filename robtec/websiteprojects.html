          <h1>What is a website?</h1>
        <br>
          <p>I can tell you one thing: if you have a company and you don't yet have a website, you're way behind the competition!
            In this article you'll learn about this topical subject that will bring more visibility to your business.</p>
            
            <br>
    
            <p>Website is a combination of the words web (network) and site (site), meaning that a website is a place on the web. 
            It is the word used to define the place where one or more pages are available to be accessed via the Internet. 
            There are some basic elements that a website usually has. We'll explain them from the point of view of a business, 
            but they are fully applicable to other causes, such as: Personal blog, Non-profit organizations, News portals, Official pages
            Event pages. </p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="content">
        <p>To give you an example, imagine a physical store as a website, or just a website for short. 
            The entrance to the store is the main page of the site, also called the Home page. 
            The counter can be seen as a contact page, where the customer can talk to the store. 
            The shelves are a page for displaying products, with sub-pages for each category of object.</p>
        
        </div>

    <div class="parallax-container">

        <div class="parallax-section" style="background-image: url('images/web2.jpg ');">
          <div class="content">
            
        <br>

            <p>Can you understand a bit more? This was a very basic example to help you, but a website can go much further than that. 
              Pages are customizable and adjustable according to the needs of each person or company. 
              Now visualize your business like this, and imagine how many people can visit your company online.</p>

              
        <br>
              
              <p>According to data from Globo's G1 news portal, the 2018 ICT Households survey shows that 126.9 million Brazilians use the internet. 
              Imagine today? That number is only growing. This proves the importance of companies having an online presence, 
              regardless of their size or area of activity. If you're not seen by these people as being able to help them, then it's time to change that. 
              Wow, that's a lot.</p>
